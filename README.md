# Lifeguard Rotation Tracker

## Description

- I was motivated to develop this program for my managers from my lifeguarding job because they told me it would be a great application for them to utilize throughout the work day.

- I decided to build the program to practice my knowledge with JavaScript, Web APIs, and Local Storage. I also wanted to showcase a program I made that was able to solve real-world problems.

- With this program, my managers, supervisors, and headguards will be able to keep track of every lifeguard's current stand based on the current time and rotation. The program also has some additional features which allow the user to save the current rotation number, rotation time, stand names, and lifeguard names in the correct order in case they lose connection to the website or need the data to make a new plan.

- While there are still many features I wish to add to the program in the coming months, this project has taught me why it is important to code the minimum viable product first so that I can get some feedback and usage. It would not benefit me or the user if I decided to hold off from publishing something because I would be stuck working on the program until it was perfect, and the user would not be able to solve their problems in the meantime. Additionally, users might not even want all the additional features, which is another reason why feedback is important to have so that I can work on what users really want.

## Usage

Use the "Add Stand" and "Remove Stand" buttons at the bottom to generate the needed amount of stands.

Use the left and right arrows at the top to go through the rotation numbers and its respective time. When the right arrow is clicked, the lifeguard names will rotate one stand down. When the left arrow is clicked, the lifeguard names will rotate one stand up. Press the save button to store the current rotation number, time, and data in the input fields.
