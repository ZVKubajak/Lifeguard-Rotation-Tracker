# Lifeguard Rotation Tracker

## Description

A frontend application for pool supervisors and managers to track the rotation schedule of their lifeguards. Used to prevent lifeguards from going to the wrong stands and helps keep a record of each position in case of emergency.

## Usage

Visit the deployed site [here](https://zvkubajak.github.io/Lifeguard-Rotation-Tracker/).

Use the "Add Stand" and "Remove Stand" buttons at the bottom to generate the needed amount of stands.

Use the left and right arrows at the top to go through the rotation numbers and its respective time. When the right arrow is clicked, the lifeguard names will rotate one stand down. When the left arrow is clicked, the lifeguard names will rotate one stand up. Press the save button to store the current rotatiom number, time, and data in the input fields.
